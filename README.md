# üè† House Price Prediction ‚Äì Regression with PyCaret

## 1. Problem Statement and Goal of Project

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using a regression model built with the **PyCaret** library. The dataset used is the **House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset, which involves predicting the `SalePrice` of homes based on various features like neighborhood, size, and condition.

## 2. Solution Approach

* **Data Preprocessing**

  * Loaded and cleaned the dataset, handling missing values by imputing with the mean.
  * Applied normalization and dimensionality reduction (PCA) to enhance model performance.

* **Model Setup**

  * Used PyCaret‚Äôs `setup()` function to prepare the dataset, excluding irrelevant features like `Alley` and `PoolQC`, which are not helpful for regression.

* **Model Creation and Comparison**

  * Applied multiple regression models using PyCaret‚Äôs `compare_models()` to find the best-performing one.
  * Fine-tuned hyperparameters and evaluated the models based on performance metrics like RMSE.

* **Interpretation and Insights**

  * Once the best model was selected, PyCaret‚Äôs built-in `interpret_model()` function was used for analyzing model predictions and understanding feature importance.

## 3. Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**
* **PyCaret** ‚Äì A low-code machine learning library for building and deploying models efficiently.
* **Pandas** ‚Äì For data manipulation and handling.
* **Matplotlib** ‚Äì For visualization (if applicable).

## 4. Description about Dataset

* **train-houseprice.csv** ‚Äì The training dataset containing house features (e.g., `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `GarageCars`) and the target variable `SalePrice`.
* **test-houseprice.csv** ‚Äì The test dataset for which predictions were made.

The dataset includes several categorical and numerical features, which were processed using techniques like **one-hot encoding** and **numerical imputation**.
